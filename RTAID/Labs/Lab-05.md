# Document Structure 

The lab includes steps for the user to follow along with associated screenshots that provide visual aid. In each screenshot, sections are
highlighted with orange boxes to indicate the area(s) user should focus on.

# Introduction 

In this lab, you will use the data you have streamed and loaded into your KQL Database and succinctly linked to a Lakehouse using shortcuts
to create a Real-Time Dashboard for visualizing and sharing your insights from the data streams you accessed. By the end of this lab, you will have learned:

-   Creating a Real-Time Dashboard in Fabric

-   Using KQL to write queries to populate visuals in a dashboard

-   Adding conditional formatting to dashboard visuals

# Real-Time Dashboards

## Task 1: Create a Real-Time Dashboard

1.  Open the **Fabric workspace** for the course.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-05/image5.png)

2.  Click on the **+ New** **Item** button to create a new item.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image6.png)  

3.  You will see a category for **Visualize Data**. Click on the item called **Real-Time Dashboard**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-05/image7.png)

4.  Give your Real-Time Dashboard the name **RTI Dashboard** and then click on **Create**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image8.png)

5.  You should be immediately taken to a blank instance of a Real-Time Dashboard.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image9.png)

## Task 2: Connect a Data Source to Real-Time Dashboard

1.  Under the Home ribbon find the option called **New data source** and click it.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image10.png)
    
2.  In the flyout pane that appears on the right-hand side of the screen, click on **Add +** and then choose **OneLake data hub**.

     ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image11.png)
    
4.  A list of available sources in your OneLake will appear, only sources from KQL Databases will be listed so one option will be
    available for you, the **eh_Fabrikam** KQL Database. Select that option.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-05/image12.png)
    
4.  At the bottom of the screen click **Connect**.

    ![A green and orange rectangle with white text Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image13.png)

5.  You will now be able to create the data source. Click on the **Add** button at the bottom of the flyout pane.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-05/image14.png)

6.  You will now see that one data source has been added to the Real-Time Dashboard. From here you could add additional KQL
    Databases should the need arise. For now, click on **Close** at the bottom of the window.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image15.png)

## Task 3: Create a Real-Time Dashboard Tile with KQL

1.  Click on the blank tile within the dashboard to populate the tile with a visual.

    ![A screenshot of a web page Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image16.png)

2.  By default you will connect to the KQL Database you created earlier as your source. From here you can write out your own KQL query to
    populate this visual with data. Delete all previous markdown KQL that is there by default. Copy and paste the following query into
    the query window.

   ![](../media/Lab-05/image17.emf)

3.  Run the query once you have it configured correctly to see the results.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-05/image18.png)

4.  Notice that you may only have one result in your output. This is because of the **Time range** that is set by default for this tile.
    You have a parameter with which you can alter the range of time with which you are returning data from. The eventDate between (\_startTime..\_endTime) is what allows you to take advantage of this parameter. Modify the **Time Range** parameter to **Last 3 hours** and observe how your output changes.

    ![A screenshot of a search box Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image19.png)

5.  You should now see in your query output the results of clicks over the last 3 hour window.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image20.png)

6.  While this parameter can be modified, you may wish for it to default to a specific time range instead of forcing users to modify it.
    Above the time range option, click on the **@ Parameters** option.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image21.png)

7.  Click the **pencil icon** to edit the **Time range** parameter.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image22.png)

8.  Change the **Default value** to **Last 24 hours** to always show the last day by default. Click **Done** when finished.

    ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/Lab-05/image23.png)

9.  Close the parameter pane.

10. Now click on the **+ Add visual button** above the query results.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image24.png)

11. A new flyout will appear on the right-hand side of the screen. Click in the text box underneath the **Tile name** option to give this
    visual the name **Clicks by Hour**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer screen Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image25.png)

12. By default, the visual that you're using to display the results of this KQL query is a table. This may not be the best way for someoneto quickly consume and comprehend what is happening with the results of your data. Change the type of visual from a table to an **Area chart**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image26.png)

13. With this newly formatted visual, you can better understand the peaks and valleys of Clicks from your e-commerce site using the data stream you created earlier in this class.

    ![A graph on a screen Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image27.png)

14. To save this visual down to the Dashboard, click on the **Apply changes** button in the top-right corner of the screen.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image28.png)

15. Once this visual has been placed within the Dashboard, notice again that the visual is only showing the last hour of results. Modify the Dashboard to show the **Time Range** of the **Last 24 hours**.

    ![A graph with blue lines Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image29.png)

16. Refresh the visual and notice that the results will slightly change to reflect the data that has come in since the last execution of the query.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image30.png)

## Task 4: Add More Dashboard Tiles to Real-Time Dashboard

1.  From the **Home ribbon** in the Real-Time Dashboard click on the **New tile** button.

    ![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically generated](../media/Lab-05/image31.png)

2.  Enter the following KQL query into the query pane.

# Summary

In this lab, users created a Real-Time Dashboard and connected it to our KQL Database. We got to see that we use the KQL language to curate
queries and then we can visualize the results in many ways, with each visual having its own configuration. As well we saw how we could
modify the default parameter available in the dashboard and make it so the dashboard will automatically refresh.
