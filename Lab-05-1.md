## Document structure

The lab includes steps for the user to follow along with associated screenshots that provide visual aid. In each screenshot, sections are highlighted with orange boxes to indicate the area(s) user should focus on.

## Introduction

In this lab, you will use the data you have streamed and loaded into your KQL Database and succinctly linked to a Lakehouse using shortcuts to create a Real-Time Dashboard for visualizing and sharing your insights from the data streams you accessed.

By the end of this lab, you will have learned:

- Creating a Real-Time Dashboard in Fabric
- Using KQL to write queries to populate visuals in a dashboard
- Adding conditional formatting to dashboard visuals

## Real-Time Dashboards

### Task 1: Create a Real-Time Dashboard

1. Open the **Fabric workspace** for the course.

   ![A screenshot of a computer](./media/image178.png)

2. Click on the **+ New** drop-down menu to create a new item.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image179.png)
3. The item you are looking for isn't on this list, so go to the option at the bottom of the list called **More options** and click on it.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image180.png)

4. Scroll to the bottom of the page and you will see a category for **Real-Time Intelligence**. Click on the item called **Real-Time Dashboard**.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image181.png)

5. Give your Real-Time Dashboard the name **RTI Dashboard** and then click on **Create**.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image182.png)

6. You should be immediately taken to a blank instance of a Real-Time Dashboard.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image183.png)

### Task 2: Connect a Data Source to Real-Time Dashboard

1. Under the Home ribbon find the option called **New data source** and click it.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image184.png)

2. In the flyout pane that appears on the right-hand side of the screen, click on **Add +** and then choose **OneLake data hub**.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image185.png)
3. A list of available sources in your OneLake will appear, only sources from KQL Databases will be listed so one option will be available for you, the **eh_Fabrikam** KQL Database. Select that option.

   ![A screenshot of a computer](./media/image186.png)

4. At the bottom of the screen click **Connect**.

   ![A green and orange rectangle with white text Description automatically generated](./media/image187.png)

5. You will now be able to create the data source. Click on the **Add** button at the bottom of the flyout pane.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image188.png)

6. You will now see that one data source has been added to the Real-Time Dashboard. From here you could add additional KQL Databases should the need arise. For now, click on **Close** at the bottom of the window.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image189.png)

### Task 3: Create a Real-Time Dashboard Tile with KQL

1. Click on the blank tile within the dashboard to populate the tile with a visual.

   ![A screenshot of a web page Description automatically generated](./media/image190.png)
   
3. By default you will connect to the KQL Database you created earlier as your source. From here you can write out your own KQL query to populate this visual with data. Delete all previous markdown KQL that is there by default. Copy and paste the following query into the query window.

   ```
      //Clicks by hour
   Clicks
   | where eventDate between (_startTime.._endTime)
   | summarize date_count = count() by bin(eventDate, 1h) 
   | render timechart  
   | top 30 by date_count

    ```

4. Run the query once you have it configured correctly to see the results.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image192.png)

5. Notice that you may only have one result in your output. This is because of the **Time range** that is set by default for this tile. You have a parameter with which you can alter the range of time with which you are returning data from. The eventDate between (\_startTime..\_endTime) is what allows you to take advantage of this parameter. Modify the **Time Range** parameter to **Last 3 hours** and observe how your output changes.

   ![A screenshot of a search box Description automatically generated](./media/image193.png)

6. You should now see in your query output the results of clicks over the last 3 hour window.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image194.png)

7. While this parameter can be modified, you may wish for it to default to a specific time range instead of forcing users to modify it. Above the time range option, click on the **@ Parameters** option.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image195.png)

8. Click the **pencil icon** to edit the **Time range** parameter.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image196.png)

9. Change the **Default value** to **Last 24 hours** to always show the last day by default. Click **Done** when finished.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image197.png)

10. Close the parameter pane.

11. Now click on the **+ Add visual button** above the query results.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image198.png)

12. A new flyout will appear on the right-hand side of the screen. Click in the text box underneath the **Tile name** option to give this visual the name **Clicks by Hour**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer screen Description automatically generated](./media/image199.png)

13. By default, the visual that you're using to display the results of this KQL query is a table. This may not be the best way for someone to quickly consume and comprehend what is happening with the results of your data. Change the type of visual from a table to an **Area chart**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image200.png)

14. With this newly formatted visual, you can better understand the peaks and valleys of Clicks from your e-commerce site using the data stream you created earlier in this class.

    ![A graph on a screen Description automatically generated](./media/image201.png)

15. To save this visual down to the Dashboard, click on the **Apply changes** button in the top-right corner of the screen.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image202.png)

16. Once this visual has been placed within the Dashboard, notice again that the visual is only showing the last hour of results. Modify the Dashboard to show the **Time Range** of the **Last 24 hours**.

    ![A graph with blue lines Description automatically generated](./media/image203.png)

17. Refresh the visual and notice that the results will slightly change to reflect the data that has come in since the last execution of the query.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image204.png)

### Task 4: Add More Dashboard Tiles to Real-Time Dashboard

1. From the **Home ribbon** in the Real-Time Dashboard click on the **New tile** button.

   ![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically generated](./media/image205.png)

2. Enter the following KQL query into the query pane.

   ```
   //Impressions by hour
   Impressions
   | where eventDate between (_startTime.._endTime)
   | summarize date_count = count() by bin(eventDate, 1h) 
   | render timechart  
   | top 30 by date_count
   
   ```
3. **Run** the query.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image207.png)

4. Click the **+ Add** visual button.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image208.png)

   ![A screenshot of a screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image209.png)

6. Apply changes to the visual.

   ![A close up of a sign Description automatically generated](./media/image210.png)

7. Add another **+ New tile**.

   ![A screenshot of a graph Description automatically generated](./media/image211.png)

8. Copy and paste the following query into the query pane. Note, this is a multi-statement query that uses multiple let statements & a query combined by semicolons.

   ```
   //Clicks, Impressions, CTR
   
   let imp =  Impressions
   | where eventDate  between (_startTime.._endTime)
   | extend dateOnly = substring(todatetime(eventDate).tostring(), 0, 10) 
   | summarize imp_count = count() by dateOnly; 
   
   let clck = Clicks
   | where eventDate  between (_startTime.._endTime)
   | extend dateOnly = substring(todatetime(eventDate).tostring(), 0, 10) 
   | summarize clck_count = count() by dateOnly;
   
   imp  
   | join clck on $left.dateOnly == $right.dateOnly 
   | project selected_date = dateOnly , impressions = imp_count , clicks = clck_count, CTR = clck_count * 100 / imp_count
   
   ```

9. **Run** the query to view the results.

   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image213.png)

10. Click the **+ Add visual** button.

11. When the visual settings appear modify the following settings to create a count of Impressions.

    - **Tile name** - Impressions
    - **Visual type** - Stat
    - **Value column** - impressions (long)

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image214.png)

12. Choose **Apply changes** when all settings are configured appropriately.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image215.png)

13. On the new tile, click on the ellipses (...) and select the option to **Duplicate tile**.

14. Click on the **pencil icon** for the duplicated tile to edit the configurations.

    ![A screenshot of a computer game Description automatically generated](./media/image217.png)

15. Rename this **Tile name** to **Clicks** and change the **Value column** to **clicks (long)**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image218.png)

16. Apply the changes to this visual.

17. Duplicate either one of the new tiles one more time to create one final stat visual.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image219.png)

18. Edit the new tile to change the **Tile name** to **Click Through Rate** and the **Value column** to **CTR (long)**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image220.png)
19. Apply the changes.

20. If the tiles are separated or you wish to reorganize them, you can hover over the tile until a hand icon appears and drag and drop the visual where you wish.

    ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](./media/image221.png)

### Task 5: Add Map Visual for Impressions by Location

1. Add a **New tile** to the Real-Time Dashboard.

   ![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically generated](./media/image222.png)

2. Copy and paste the following query into the query pane. This query extracts the latitude and longitude from the Ip address column from this data stream to generate a location that you can plot on a map. This query can take a little bit more time than the previous ones.

   ```
   //Impressions by location
   
   Impressions
   | where eventDate  between (_startTime.._endTime)
   | join external_table('products') on $left.productId == $right.ProductID 
   | project lon = toreal(geo_info_from_ip_address(ip_address).longitude), lat = toreal(geo_info_from_ip_address(ip_address).latitude), Name 
   | render scatterchart with (kind = map) //, xcolumn=lon, ycolumns=lat)

   ```
4. Execute the query to validate that it is configured correctly. Click the **+ Add visual** button.

## Summary

In this lab, users created a Real-Time Dashboard and connected it to our KQL Database. We got to see that we use the KQL language to curate queries and then we can visualize the results in many ways, with each visual having its own configuration. As well we saw how we could modify the default parameter available in the dashboard and make it so the dashboard will automatically refresh.
